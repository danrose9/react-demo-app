# React Demo Application

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and then modified to include other libraries.

## Purpose

The purpose of creating this projects was initially as a object to learn React and other libraries such as react-router-dom, styled-components plus others. I will attempt to keep a full list of 3rd party libraries that I have used, but you can take a peek at the dependacies for more detail.

### Why this type of demo app?

You could say that the type of app built for this demo is very typical of what a lot of businesses tend to build, so I wanted to create something along those lines.
